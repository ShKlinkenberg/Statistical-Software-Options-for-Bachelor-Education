## Introduction

Statistical analysis plays a critical role in social science education, equipping students with essential skills for data analysis, research, and evidence-based decision-making. Selecting the right statistical software for bachelor education is crucial to meet learning objectives, improve engagement, and prepare students for professional roles. This report outlines and evaluates several statistical software options suitable for undergraduate education, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and possible combinations for optimal learning outcomes.

This report was commissioned by the collage of communication science at the University of Amsterdam. The report aims to provide an overview of statistical software options and provide recommendations for implementation.

### R with RStudio

Overview:  
R is a free, open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that enhances R's usability.  

Key Features:  
- Open-source and free to use  
- Extensive libraries for statistical modeling, machine learning, and visualization  
- Ability to write reproducible research reports (R Markdown)  

Advantages:  
- Cost-effective (free and open source)  
- Highly flexible with community-driven packages  
- Prepares students for data science and research careers  

Limitations:  
- Steeper learning curve for non-coding students  
- Requires familiarity with scripting and debugging  

Use Cases:  
Best suited for bachelor courses focusing on advanced statistical analysis, reproducible research, and data science.

### Python
Overview:  
Python is a versatile, open-source programming language that supports a wide range of applications, including data analysis and machine learning.  

Key Features:  
- Rich libraries for data analysis (NumPy, pandas), visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), and machine learning (scikit-learn)  
- Widely used in industry, academia, and data science  

Advantages:  
- Open-source and free to use  
- Versatile language applicable to multiple fields (not just statistics)  
- Prepares students for careers in data science, machine learning, and AI  

Limitations:  
- Steeper learning curve for students new to coding  
- Students need to install and manage libraries and environments  

Use Cases:  
Suitable for advanced bachelor courses in data science, computational social science, and research with large, complex datasets.

### Jupyter Notebook

Overview:  
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application for creating and sharing documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.  

Key Features:  
- Supports multiple languages, including Python, R, and Julia  
- Interactive notebooks for collaborative research and educational materials  
- Used in teaching, research, and exploratory data analysis  

Advantages:  
- Open-source and free to use  
- Combines code, output, and explanations in one document  
- Prepares students for the "notebook-style" analysis used in industry and academia  

Limitations:  
- May require prior coding knowledge (often paired with Python or R)  
- Requires environment setup (e.g., Anaconda)  

Use Cases:  
Jupyter Notebooks are ideal for exploratory data analysis and teaching computational concepts interactively.

### Excel

Overview:  
Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program that allows for basic statistical analysis and visualization.  

Key Features:  
- Intuitive, user-friendly interface  
- Built-in statistical functions, pivot tables, and charting tools  
- No coding required  

Advantages:  
- Easy to learn and widely used in the industry  
- No need for additional software installations (part of Office Suite)  

Limitations:  
- Limited statistical functionality compared to SPSS, R, or Python  
- Not suitable for large datasets or complex statistical models  

Use Cases:  
Useful for introductory courses where students learn about data organization, descriptive statistics, and visualization.

### LLM ChatGPT Data Analyst (Custom GPT)
Overview:  
Custom-trained large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can serve as "AI Data Analysts" by providing code suggestions, statistical explanations, and data manipulation guidance.  

Key Features:  
- AI assistant for data analysis, code generation, and report generation  
- Can suggest R, Python, or SQL code snippets for statistical analysis  
- Interactive, question-and-answer format  

Advantages:  
- Helps students learn statistical concepts interactively  
- Offers real-time explanations, tutoring, and coding guidance  

Limitations:  
- Relies on API access and may have data privacy concerns  
- Not a replacement for hands-on learning with traditional software  

Use Cases:  
LLMs can supplement learning by providing personalized support for students working with R, Python, or Excel.

## Combinations of Software for Optimal Learning

- SPSS + Excel: For introductory statistics courses.  
- R with RStudio + Jupyter Notebook: For data science and computational courses.
